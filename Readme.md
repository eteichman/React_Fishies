This project is still a work in progress.

My future plans for this project:

- To add a database and a Python/Django API. I already started writing the SQL scripts for the database - you can see it in the src\SQL folder.
- To continue migrating all the JS files over to TypeScript.
- To add custom styling to the dropdowns.
- To add a dark/light theme Context.
- To add a "Sort by" dropdown to sort the results on the home page
- Improve the modal accessiblity - trap the focus there when it is opened
- Possibly add an SVG spinner
- Possibly to add a search in the header
